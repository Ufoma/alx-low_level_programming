2. The function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. Function that shows the length of a string.
4. A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
5. A function that prints a string in reverse.
6. A function that reverses a string.
7. A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. function that prints out the second half of the string.
9. A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. A function that copies the string pointed to, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to.
