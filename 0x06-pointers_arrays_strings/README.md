Advanced C - pointers, arrays and strings
NOTE:
This project includes the following guidelines but not limited to;
1. Each code uses the betty style and it is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
2. No more than five functions per file
3. For this project, no use of standard library

TASKS
a) 0-strcat.c : This file consists of a function that concatenates two strings
b) 1-strncat.c : This also concatenates two strings except that
	it will use at most n bytes from src; and
	src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
c) 2-strncpy.c : Contains functions that copies a string
d) 3-strcmp.c : compares two strings
e) 4-rev_array.c : a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
f) 5-string_toupper.c : contains a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
g) 6-cap_string.c : This file contains a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
h) 7-leet.c - This file contains a function that encodes a string into 1337.
	Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
	Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
	Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
	Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
	Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
	Prototype: char *leet(char *);
	You can only use one if in your code
	You can only use two loops in your code
	You are not allowed to use switch
	You are not allowed to use any ternary operation

And five other advanced tasks on pointers, arrays and strings all in C
